# Language-Translation
Combination of different NMT architectures for Machine Translation Task. Currently, GCNN (Gated Convolution Neural Network) model is completed for German to English Translation and it has a BLEU score of 32.4.

## Future Works:
1. Currently, preprocessing for English to Hindi Translation is being done after which its performance will be checked.
2. For improving performance BERT model will be tried and checked.
